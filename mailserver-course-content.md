# 📅 Course Roadmap — 5 Days to Mastery

---

## 🌅 **DAY 1: Foundations — The “Why” Behind Every Config Line**

> 💡 *“Don’t configure what you don’t understand.”*

### 📌 Module 1.1: Email Ecosystem Decoded
- How email actually works — from “Send” to “Inbox” (with animated flow)
- MUA → MSA → MTA → MDA — explained with postal service analogy 📮
- Real-world case: Why NGO X migrated from Gmail to self-hosted (cost + compliance)

### 📌 Module 1.2: Protocols Demystified (SMTP, IMAP, POP3, TLS)
- Ports, handshakes, encryption — with Wireshark screenshots
- Submission (587) vs Relay (25) — when to use which?
- STARTTLS vs SSL/TLS — why your config fails without this

### 📌 Module 1.3: DNS & Deliverability — The Silent Killers
- MX, A, PTR, SPF, DKIM, DMARC — visual config builders
- Why your email goes to spam — even with “perfect” setup
- Live demo: Fix a failing DMARC record in Cloudflare

### 📌 Module 1.4: Security Layers That Matter
- Spam, phishing, spoofing — attack vectors + defense
- Greylisting, RBLs, SpamAssassin, ClamAV — how they work together
- MTA-STS, DANE — next-gen transport security (optional deep dive)

### 📌 Module 1.5: Pre-Reqs & System Sizing — No Guesswork
- **Calculator Included**:  
  `RAM = (Users × 0.5MB) + (Daily Volume × 2MB) + Buffer`  
  `Disk = Avg Email Size × Daily Volume × Retention × 3x Safety`  
- OS Tuning: Ubuntu vs Rocky Linux — which for prod?
- Network Prep: Static IP, PTR, Firewall Rules, Time Sync

### 📌 Module 1.6: Mail Server Types — Choose Your Weapon
| Type | Best For | Tools | Difficulty |
|------|----------|-------|------------|
| On-Prem Self-Hosted | Compliance, Cost Control | Postfix + Dovecot | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Cloud Hosted (VM) | Scalability, Redundancy | AWS EC2 + Let’s Encrypt | ⭐⭐ |
| Dockerized (Mailcow) | Speed, All-in-One | Docker + Mailcow | ⭐ |
| Kubernetes (Advanced) | Microservices Enthusiasts | Helm + Mailu | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

> 🎁 **BONUS**: Comparison matrix — Self-hosted vs Gmail Workspace vs Zoho Mail (Cost, Control, Compliance)

---

## 🛠️ **DAY 2: Hands-On — Build Your First Production Mail Server (On-Prem Style)**

> 💪 *“Theory is useless without muscle memory.”*

### 🧩 Step-by-Step Lab: Postfix + Dovecot + Roundcube on Ubuntu 22.04

✅ **Step 1**: Server Prep  
 → Set FQDN, hostname, static IP, update system  
✅ **Step 2**: DNS Setup  
 → Configure MX, A, PTR, SPF, generate DKIM key, publish DMARC  
✅ **Step 3**: Install & Tune Postfix  
 → Interactive setup → Edit `main.cf` → Test with `telnet`  
✅ **Step 4**: Configure Dovecot for IMAP/POP3 + SSL  
 → Enable virtual users → Test login with `openssl s_client`  
✅ **Step 5**: MariaDB for Virtual Users  
 → Create tables → Link to Postfix/Dovecot → Test auth  
✅ **Step 6**: Roundcube Webmail  
 → Apache + PHP setup → User login → Send test email  
✅ **Step 7**: Harden with Fail2ban + UFW  
 → Block brute-force → Log analysis drill  
✅ **Step 8**: Validate with Mail-Tester.com → Aim for 10/10!

> 🧪 **Lab Challenge**: Break your own server — then fix it (learning through failure!)
