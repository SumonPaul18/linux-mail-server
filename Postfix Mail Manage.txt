## Postfix Queue Management

Analyze mails in queue:
mailq
or
postqueue -p

#Read an email from mail queue
#Every message in queue has a unique id.
postcat -q  DA80E24A0A      
or
#Using ‘v’ will display extra information.
postcat -qv  DA80E24A0A     

#Show postfix log
tail -f /var/log/mail.log

#Flushing entire queue immediately
postqueue -f

#Delete all queued mail
postsuper -d ALL

#Delete All Deferred Mails
postsuper -d ALL deferred

#Delete a single mail from queue
postsuper -d DA80E24A0A

#Delete mails to a specific mail address
#You need to some work here as postfix has no direct command for this.
#Following sample is taken from postsuper man page:

mailq | tail -n +2 | grep -v '^ *(' | awk  'BEGIN { RS = "" } { if ($8 == "USER@EXAMPLE.COM" && $9 == "") print $1 } ' | tr -d '*!' | postsuper -d -

#Just replace USER@EXAMPLE.COM with receiver email address.

#$8 will contain recipient1 email-address, $9 will contain recipient2 email-address.

#If you want to filter from-email address, use $7 variable.
